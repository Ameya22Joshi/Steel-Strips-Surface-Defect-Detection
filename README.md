# Steel-Strips-Surface-Defect-Detection

Automatic metallic surface defect inspection has received increased attention in relation to the quality control of industrial products across industries. This project aims to automatically detect metal surface defects such as rolled-in scale, patches, crazing, pitted surface, inclusion and scratches (as depicted in the image below) in Hot-Rolled Steel Strips. The defects are classified into their specific classes via a convolutional neural network (CNN)
